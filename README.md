# üß† Beginner-Level Product Recommendation System

*A Content-Based Filtering Project | AI Placement Drive Hackathon 2025*

---

## üìò Overview

This project implements a **content-based product recommendation system** developed as part of the **Beginner Track (0‚Äì2 years)** in the **AI Placement Drive Hackathon 2025**. Using product metadata and textual descriptions, it recommends similar products by leveraging **TF-IDF vectorization** and **cosine similarity**.

## üöÄ Problem Approach & Methodology

üìå Dataset: Amazon Product Metadata  
üìå Approach:

- Selected features: `Product Name`, `About Product`, `Category`, `Selling Price`
- Dropped missing/irrelevant entries
- Used **TF-IDF** to vectorize textual fields
- Calculated **cosine similarity** for recommendations
- Built modular functions with interactive output
- Evaluated with **Precision@5**, **Coverage**, and **Similarity Score**

## üìù Best AI Project Summary

This AI project is a **content-based recommendation system** designed to suggest similar products using product metadata. It applies TF-IDF vectorization to product titles and descriptions, and identifies top matches using cosine similarity. The system was built in a Kaggle notebook and uses standard ML libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib.

Although I am new to the field of AI/ML, I am highly motivated to learn. I took up this project with the intention to explore real-world applications of machine learning. This project helped me understand essential workflows‚Äîpreprocessing, modeling, and evaluation‚Äîwhile using AI tools like ChatGPT for guidance in documentation and idea validation.

The experience has deepened my interest in intelligent systems and strengthened my resolve to pursue more AI/ML learning opportunities going forward.
